# Featherweight

A small Unity game / game demo for PC/Linux/Mac/Android platforms.
A little weekend project.
Fly around in a paper plane, enjoy the scenery, and try to hit little objects to pick up speed.

The skybox ("Fantasy Skybox") is a free asset from Unity Asset Store. A Readme written by its creators is found in this repo at: Assets/Material/Imported/Fantasy Skybox FREE/Readme.txt

Only the Android build is included because of the hefty amount of files Unity builds on other platforms come with. The .apk file is downloadable and runnable, if it is seen as safe enough.

I uploaded a small video clip of the game in action to Imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/PLTTPkK]
